## 📂 Topics Covered

Below are the major DSA topics included, each with definitions and problem explanations 👇

---

### 1. 🔁 **For Loops**
- **Definition**: A `for` loop is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code for a specified number of iterations.
- **Description**: This section contains problems that demonstrate how to use `for loops` to iterate through sequences and solve algorithmic challenges efficiently.

---

### 2. 🔄 **While Loops**
- **Definition**: A `while loop` continuously executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
- **Description**: Explore problems that use `while loops`, which are useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

---

### 3. 🔃 **Do-While Loops**
- **Definition**: A `do-while loop` executes a block of code at least once, then repeats the process as long as the specified condition remains true.
- **Description**: Practice solving problems where you need to guarantee that the block of code runs at least one time before checking the condition.

---

### 4. 🔷 **Patterns**
- **Definition**: Pattern-based problems involve printing specific sequences or shapes in a structured format, typically using nested loops.
- **Description**: This section covers problems where you create different types of patterns such as number pyramids, inverted triangles, and star-based designs.

---

### 5. 🧠 **Functions**
- **Definition**: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be invoked with different inputs to return outputs.
- **Description**: Learn how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts by defining and calling functions.

---

### 6. 📦 **Arrays**
- **Definition**: An array is a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Description**: Solve problems involving array manipulation, such as searching, sorting, and modifying elements in an array.

---

### 7. 🔍 **Searching**
- **Definition**: Searching algorithms are used to find an element in a data structure (like an array or list).
- **Description**: This section covers common searching algorithms such as **linear search** (iterative) and **binary search** (efficient for sorted arrays).

---

### 8. 📊 **Sorting**
- **Definition**: Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, often in ascending or descending order.
- **Description**: Implement classic sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**, each with different time complexities and use cases.

---

### 9. 🧮 **2D Arrays**
- **Definition**: A 2D array is an array of arrays, commonly used to represent matrices or grids of data.
- **Description**: Practice problems that involve matrix manipulation, grid traversal, and other operations on 2D arrays.

---

### 10. 🔠 **Strings**
- **Definition**: A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
- **Description**: Work with various string manipulation techniques, including reversing strings, checking for palindromes, and performing pattern matching.

---

### 11. 🔁 **Recursion**
- **Definition**: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to break a problem down into smaller subproblems.
- **Description**: Solve problems using recursion, such as calculating factorials, solving the Fibonacci sequence, or exploring tree traversal methods.

---

### 12. 🔙 **Backtracking**
- **Definition**: Backtracking is a method used to solve problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and then discarding those that fail to meet the problem's constraints.
- **Description**: Learn how to solve problems like the **N-Queens problem** or **subset sum** using the backtracking approach.

---

### 13. ✂️ **Divide & Conquer**
- **Definition**: Divide and conquer is a strategy where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, which are solved independently, and then the results are combined.
- **Description**: Implement algorithms like **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort**, which use divide-and-conquer principles to solve problems more efficiently.

---

### 14. ⚙️ **Bit Manipulation**
- **Definition**: Bit manipulation is the act of performing operations directly on the binary representation of numbers.
- **Description**: Explore problems that optimize solutions using bitwise operators for efficient computation, such as flipping bits or checking if a number is a power of two.

---

### 15. ⏱ **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Definition**: Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, and space complexity measures the amount of memory it consumes.
- **Description**: Understand the performance of algorithms by analyzing their time and space complexity, and learn to optimize your solutions accordingly.

---

### 16. 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Definition**: Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. It is based on concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Description**: Learn how to design software using **OOP principles** by creating classes, objects, and leveraging inheritance and polymorphism.

---

### 17. 💰 **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Definition**: A greedy algorithm makes the best possible choice at each step, with the hope that these local solutions will lead to a globally optimal solution.
- **Description**: Solve problems using greedy techniques, such as **activity selection**, **fractional knapsack**, or **coin change**.

---

### 18. 🧺 **Linear Data Structures**
- **Definition**: Linear data structures are data structures in which elements are stored sequentially, such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- **Description**: Implement and solve problems using **stacks**, **queues**, and **linked lists**, which are foundational data structures in computer science.
